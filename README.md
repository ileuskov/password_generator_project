Hey there! I'm moving forward with my web dev projects and decided to create a couple small apps via django. 

This app is called password generator. And it makes ... a randomly generated password! 

I love Web development so much that I just cannot stop programming some little projects and learning new technologies. 
I was able to make some static pages with HTML/CSS/JS but I wanted to learn how to deploy and maintain my sites dynamically without using just Node.js and the terminal

This is why I decided to move towards the Python back end and learn Django 3.0. This is my first project in this area

The app is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) Python 3.8
3) Django 3.0

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
